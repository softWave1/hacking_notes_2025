# like1000

# Description
This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.
# Solution
The file is a tar file named 1000 , after  the file is uncompressed it hass another file  named 999 and so on the 999 has a 998 file and so on so I made a for loop to  the get the files from 1000 to 1 until I found the flag  in a png image using an ocr tool like ```tesseract``` I extract the text from the image.

``` bash
for i in {1000..1};do tar -xvf $i.tar;done
tesseract flag.png output
cat output.txt
# output 
picoCTF{l0t5_0f_TAR5}
```
