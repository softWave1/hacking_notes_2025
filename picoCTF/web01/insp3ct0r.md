# Insp3ct0r

# Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511
# Solution

-  The flag is divided in three parts  in the web page like the java scrip code , the css file and one more , using the browser feature inspect i could find out the flag.

``` bash

Flag:picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}

```
