# Description
How to automate tasks to run at intervals on linux servers?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

# Solution 

-  I only use the command ```cat``` on the /etc/crontab file 

``` bash
cat /etc/crontab
picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_d83baed1}
```

# Additional notes

Probably this is not the "right"  way to solve this challenge but i'm happy with my progress since i can become better at the class.
