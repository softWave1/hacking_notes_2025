# Solution

Using a different syntax for bypassing the function that changes the given commands 

``` bash
# I use "" (double quotes) because of mark down sintax the actual command doesn't include double quotes

˝````````cat ````blargh/flag.txt˝
```

# Additional notes

I tried a lot of syntax alternatives like double and single quotes, back slashes but they didn't seem to work.
