# Solution

-  The flags is divided in three parts around all the branches of the git repository  so I change branch by branch until the flag was completed  

``` bash
git checkout feature/part-1 && cat flag.py && git checkout feature/part-2 && cat flag.py && git checkout feature/part-3 && cat flag.py
Switched to branch 'feature/part-1'
print("Printing the flag...")
print("picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_", end='')Switched to branch 'feature/part-2'
print("Printing the flag...")

print("m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_", end='')Switched to branch 'feature/part-3'
print("Printing the flag...")

print("w0rk_7ae8dd33}")

```
