# Redaction gone wrong
# Description
Now you DON’T see me.This [report](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/84/Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?
# Solution
- Once the file its downloaded and open it looks that the information its blocked by some bars but I only select the bars with the mouse and I was able to see the text behind

``` bash
# Flag 
picoCTF{C4n_Y0u_S33_m3_fully}
```
