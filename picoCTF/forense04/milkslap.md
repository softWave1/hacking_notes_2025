# Solution

-  Once I  am in the web page righth click on the image , copy link and then I download the image using wget once I tried to use ```zsteg``` but I found out an error.

``` bash
wget http://mercury.picoctf.net:48380/concat_v.png
zsteg -a concat_v.png 
/var/lib/gems/3.0.0/gems/zpng-0.4.5/lib/zpng/scan_line.rb:369:in `prev_scanline_byte': stack level too deep (SystemStackError)

	from /usr/local/bin/zsteg:25:in `load'
	from /usr/local/bin/zsteg:25:in `<main>'
	
```

- I solve the error by increasing the stack of ruby and finally I get the flag

```bash

```

-  final step

```bash

```
