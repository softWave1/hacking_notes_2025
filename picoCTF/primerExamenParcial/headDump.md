# Solution

-  Exploring the website there's an interesting section where it's the api documentation in the list of endpoints there's this url ```/heapdump``` that leads to a .json file where there's information about the memory of the application after downloading the file and filter its content with the ```grep``` I get the flag.

``` bash
wget http://verbal-sleep.picoctf.net:55344/heapdump
# The file downloaded name could change

cat heapdump-1744748730800.heapsnapshot | grep picoCTF{
